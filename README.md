Business Analytics Internship by Smart Internz
Project: LendingClub Issued Loans Analysis (through Qlik)
About the project:
LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending company, provides opportunities for borrowers to obtain personal loans and for investors to fund those loans for returns.
Lack of analysis of peer-to-peer lending data properly, might make bad decisions, take on more risk, lose investor trust, and break the rules.
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of peer-to-peer lending data from Lending Club to gain insights into loan performance, borrower behavior, and risk factors.
